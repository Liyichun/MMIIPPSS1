# MIPSsim
This is the first homework project of my course.

In this project you will create a simple MIPS simulator which will perform the following two tasks:

􏰀 Load a specified MIPS text file1 and generate the assembly code equivalent to the input file (disassembler).
 Please see the sample input file and disassembly output.
 
􏰀 Generate the instruction-by-instruction simulation of the MIPS code (simulator).
 It should also produce/print the contents of registers and data memories after execution of each instruction. 
 Please see the sample simulation output file.
 
You do not have to implement any exception/interrupt handling during simulation for this project.
